# Lilypod Dodge
Created 2 years ago as my first bigger python project, and the coding is therefore horrible. Posted only for documentation and availability.

## Download

```
pip install lilypod
```
Either call ./lilypod_dodge/lilypod_dodge.py in terminall or
```python
import lilypod_dodge.lilypod_dodge
```
to start the program 

## Bugs
Lilypods will sometimes spawn in middle of map.
'Multiplayer' option only plays sound.
Sometimes unknown reason of death.

## How to play

Steer with up, left and right arrow. Shoot other ducks with space. Collect coins for extra score. Watch out for lilypods and other ducks.
